## 🚀 Core Features

- **Arabic Font Support:** Integrated "Tajawal" font to ensure Arabic subtitles look modern and readable, alongside "Roboto" for English.
- **Auto Detection:** The extension analyzes the displayed text and automatically applies the appropriate formatting (Arabic or English) in real-time.

### 🛠 **UI & Control**
- **Cinematic Look:** Full control over Font Size, Color, Font Weight, Opacity, Stroke, and Shadow Intensity to mimic movie subtitles.
- **Instant Preview:** No need to refresh the page; any setting change is reflected immediately on the video.
- **YouTube Fixes:** Solves subtitle overlap/disappearance issues and hides the native YouTube options menu to prevent conflicts.
