## ✨ Features

*   **Smart Separate Customization:** Automatically detects the subtitle language and applies your specific settings (different styles for Arabic vs. English).
*   **Cinema Look:** Full control over Font Size, Color, Family, Weight, Shadow Intensity, Background Opacity, Stroke, and Position.
*   **Custom Fonts:** Includes "Tajawal" for Arabic and "Roboto" for English for a modern, readable look.
*   **High Performance:** Built with modern web technologies (MutationObserver) to ensure zero lag, with instant preview of settings changes.
*   **Fixes YouTube Bugs:** Solves issues like duplicate subtitles, text artifacts/glitches, and disappearing subtitles when switching languages.

> **⚠️ Important Note:**
> To ensure the extension works perfectly without conflicts, the native YouTube **Subtitle Options button has been hidden/removed**. Please rely entirely on the extension popup icon to customize your subtitle appearance.
